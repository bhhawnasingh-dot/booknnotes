  <h1>BookNNotes</h1>
  <p>

    not just memorize answers. Learn smarter with simple Hinglish explanations, examples,
    PDFs and student-friendly learning tools.

  <h2>Welcome to BookNNotes</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Education becomes powerful only when concepts are understood deeply. Unfortunately,
      many students struggle because learning often focuses on memorization instead of
      understanding. BookNNotes was created to solve this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      BookNNotes is an independent educational initiative designed especially for school
      students of Class 8, Class 9 and Class 10. Our goal is simple: to provide free,
      high-quality, concept-oriented study material that students can trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every topic on BookNNotes is explained in simple Hinglish language so that students
      from all backgrounds can learn comfortably without fear or confusion.
    </p>

<!-- WHY -->
<section>
  <h2>Why BookNNotes is Different</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Unlike many websites that only upload PDFs, BookNNotes focuses on explaining the
      <strong>“why”</strong> behind every concept. We believe that once a student understands
      the logic, scoring good marks becomes automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our study material includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step-by-step concept explanations</li>
      <li>Simple real-life examples</li>
      <li>Common mistakes students make</li>
      <li>Practice-oriented learning approach</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All content is created with students in mind — no copied material, no shortcuts,
      and no misleading information.
